# A Collection of Small Projects

This is a collection of small projects I've coded to demonstrate my abilities and track my progression in learning Python.

## Files Included:
+ "isprime.py": This script asks for a positive integer then gives user the options of (1) calculating if the given number is prime, (2) giving a list of prime numbers up to/including the given number, or (3) both functions.
+ "Matrix_Calculator": The Main_Matrix_Calculator file prompts the user to input a matrix and allows that matrix to be multiplied by a number.
+ "RPS_Game": Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
